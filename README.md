# Weather Sentiment Analysis
## Description
The problem we are investigating is processing text messages about the weather. We will focus on the so-called “tweets”, which are short word sequences published by people from all over the world on the X.com platform (formerly twitter.com). The aim of the project is to apply natural language processing and machine learning techniques to sentiment analysis - identifying weather information contained in a text message and determining whether the author evaluates it positively or negatively.
